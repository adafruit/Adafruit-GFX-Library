This is the core graphics library for all our displays, providing a common set of graphics primitives (points, lines, circles, etc.).  It needs to be paired with a hardware-specific library for each display device we carry (to handle the lower-level functions).

-  drawXBitmap function
   You can use the GIMP photo editor to save a .xbm file and use the array saved in the file to draw a bitmap with the drawXBitmap function. See the pull request here for more details:
